## Hi I'm Scott

I'm a developer advocate working with [GraphCMS] to create content
that helps remove friction and educate around the GraphQL space.

I create content written in the blog here and also in educational
videos supporting the written content.

I'm a second career dev, that reskilled from a VBA analyst developer
role into web development.

I'm a massive fan of the [Jamstack] I have a wealth of knowledge
working with [Gatsby] and am spending a lot of time familiarising
myself with Svelte and SvelteKit.

More details in the [portfolio section].

### Sectors I have worked in:

I have over ten years experience in working for large corporate
organisations in Finance (Risk, Asset Management), Property, Oil & Gas
and Lloyd's insurance market.

As a web developer I've worked in government digital transformation
and creative digital. Now in the content management space with
GraphCMS.

### My personality

I find it hard to identify my traits, so instead I took the
[16Personalities] test, here are [my results].

I like to think of myself as a easy to approach and friendly person.

### My interests

I'm obsessed with watching anything to do with mechanical engineering.

I play Borderlands 3 on Stadia, then Borderlands 1 and 2 on the
Nintendo Switch.

### Music I listen to

I'm a massive Drum and Bass fan, I have a Deezer playlist I like to
listen to for coding with the title for which I stole from Phil
Hawksworth:

<Deezer

/>

Other playlists I'd recommend would be Hospital Records Drum & Bass
Fresh Selections:

### Podcasts I listen to

I listen to many podcasts, here are some that I get a lot of value
from that aren't all code related:

**Darknet Diaries**

Stories of cyber threats/breaches that happened on the internet, these
are stories from the past not covering current tech security. Super
intersting to listen to.

**Random But Memorable**

From the makers od 1Password for security advice and a round-up of the
latest security news.

series covers the food delivery industry.
