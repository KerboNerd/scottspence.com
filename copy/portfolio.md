There'll be some cool SvelteKit features added here to get my GitHib
user information and show it in a graph or two.

Here's a Svelte Cubed playground of my GitHub contributions for the
last six years, you can play around with it with the mouse or the
controls here.

<span>Pick a year: <select bind:value={year}>

  <option disabled selected>Year</option>
  {#each years as year}
    <option value={year}>{year}</option>
  {/each}
</select>
</span>

<GithubContributions {contributions} />
