          Are these people actually that retarted, do they think they can just except people to throw their life away for protesting the government or get themselves killed for organising a coup. 
          Even if al Russian are Ukrainian hating nationalist, considering the huge propaganda machine Russia has I am still not gonna consider them responsible for their own thoughts. 
          Fuck r/Ukraine and al the western dumbfucks who lack critical thinking or empathy and in most cases both. 
          (Bdw never saw the same responds from these fuckers when it was the us invading iraq but then it wasn’t their fault but the media yeah sure
