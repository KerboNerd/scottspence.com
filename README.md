A blog made with SvelteKit, MDSveX, Tailwind and DaisyUI.

Massive thanks to [Matt Jennings] for the [initial template] which has
some really useful features, like images in markdown, html preview and
more.

Things that are not working in this site opposed to the Gatsby
version:

- Embeds for Twitter, Vimeo and the Markdown previewer in the
  [Markdown Showdown] post are not working.
- Observation observer for ToC is not implemented.
