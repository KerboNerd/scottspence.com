Six months ago today I started a new job as a developer advocate for
GraphCMS. This has taken me by surprise as if feels like I've only
just started still! So I think now is a good time to reflect on what I
have done in this time.

My main goal with GraphCMS is content creation so let's take a look at
what I have done in that space.

## April recap

I was onboarding for the first two weeks I was there this was mainly
me getting to know my immediate team and key people in the business.
Many one to one video calls.

## May recap

After my onboarding one of the first things I did was crete a
SvelteKit example project that used the GraphCMS eCommerce example
project all the examples are based off of.

Soon after that I was asked to talk with Brittney and Alex about
GraphCMS on the [CodingCat.dev podcast]. This was released in July

I was well on my way down the Svelte and SvelteKit rabbit hole by this
time and started to put out some more written content. [Data Binding
in Svelte] was a refreshing look at how two way data binding worked
with Svelte and how little code you have to write to get it to work.

I went a bit further toward the end of May with a [SvelteKit Starter
Blog with GraphCMS], using the GraphCMS blog schema template.

## June recap

Back to the GraphCMS examples, I created an explainer video to
accompany each of the examples in the [GraphCMS examples] repo.

Twenty odd videos between two and six minutes each, this is when I
started taking video editing seriously.

These videos took up a lot of time and effort to make for something so
short!

## July recap

A brief blog post on the GraphCMS [Examples video series].

Then a quite lengthy blog post on [Building a Personal Timeline with
GraphCMS and SvelteKit]. What I learned from this is that some content
doesn't quite fit written format.

I was on a family holiday for the last week of July.

## August recap

I was still away on holiday for the first half of August.

The first couple of days back from holiday Jamie and I came up with
the idea of creating a full [Jamstack Linktree clone] that could be
created with one click.

Then I started on the Jamstack explorers videos

## September recap

Rolling out of August I made a SvelteKit Crash Course
