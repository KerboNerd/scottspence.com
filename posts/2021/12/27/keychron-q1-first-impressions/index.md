I've now gone through quite a few mechanical keyboards in a relatively
short time. The first couple of times were to replace the current
faulty one I was using. This time around it was more of a
sustainability decision than a replacement.

First up was the [Logitech G815] because I had issues with the Ctrl
key on the [HAVIT KB395L] the [Logitech G915] seemed like a logical
next step from there for me because I didn't really vibe with the
Logitech macro keys on the far left of the board.

The G915 was (and still is) a really nice board to type on.

## Why change from the G915

The G915 was what I thought to be my "end game" board. It had the
media controls on it, which was a main decicion in me getting it. It
also had the super nice low profile Kailh switches I really liked
typing on.

The only thing is with a factory made board like this, if there's
issues with one of the switches, you can't just replace it. So, say
the Ctrl key starts playing up again (which it did). There's two
options, open up the keyboard to replace the broken part. Or replace
the entire keyboard.

When this happened I did a bit of research and found a couple of
YouTube videos:

- [Logitech G915 Disassembly]
- [Logitech G815 Disassembly]:

There's a whole lot of screws that comes out of that board! Also other
things like a heat gun you'd need (or hair drier) a soldering iron and
sourcing the new parts!

## Let's go custom!

So, I decided the best way to keep a keyboard for more than 18 months
without it breaking and having to possibly have to break out a
soldering iron was to get a keyboard that would be easily servicable.

From looking at subreddits for mechanical keyboards this looks like it
can be a bonkers expensive hobby. Something I really want to avoid!

The main criteria for me on a new board would be:

- Easily change parts when they break
- Media controls built into the board
- 75% size, so full size without the number pad

I really, really liked the volume roller on the G915.

## There's a lot to choose from

When it comes to mechanical keyboards, there's a lot to choose from.
But not a lot to choose from if you want an ISO keyboard!

I still really like the ISO keyboard layout (large enter key) and
there's surprisingly few boards out there that I could choose from.

The two candidates I found after searching was the GMMK were the
[Keychron Q1] and the [GMMK Pro].

From what I could glean from YuTube videos they both had the same
volume knob on the top right of the board. I found out later that
neither of them shipped with the knob! That was a mod you had to do
yourself.

Both options didn't ship a fully built board either so I had to go
about seeing if I could get the parts I really needed.

GMMK have a really nice customiser option on their site where you can
pick every detail of the board you want. This was only for ANSI boards
though and the ISO option was a bit more complicated.

I had to go through the ANSI customiser and pick the parts I needed
then try translate that into the ISO option.

Keychron was a similar option with only a barbone ISO board on offer.
With both options for the barbone option you get the case and the
Printed Circuit Board (PCB). You have to get switches and keycaps.

So the Keychron Q1 was what I settled on after watching many, many
YouTube videos! There were some issues with the Keychron case sounding
"pingy" but the reviewers said this was going to get fixed in the
production boards.

## Switches

The main reason I wanted a custom keyboard was to have the ability to
change the switches, but what switches do I go for?

If you are going down this path and have watched any YouTube videos on
customising keyboards, you'll see there's a lot of attention when it
comes to making the switches sound "nice".

There'll be whole sections of the videos where they're disassembling
the switches and adding film to them then applying lubricant to them
to get the nice feel.

I just want to be able to bang in the switches and not worry about it!
ðŸ˜Š

The happy medium for me was to get switched that come lubed already!
If you are paying attention to any of the videos then they will always
say it's better to lub them yourself, but I really don't have the time
or patience to do that!

When going through the GMMK option I saw they sold pre-lubed switches
GMMK Pandas. Which they sell in packs of 36 for some reason?? So I had
to get 3 packs of switches to make up the whole board.

I have always like the blue clicky switches from the Logitech G915 but
I do know that they can get super loud and annoying. The pandas seemed
like a good compromise with the tactility of a blue without the clack!

## Keycaps

One of the main reasons for going with the Keychron Q1 over the GMMK
Pro was the selection of keycaps that were available for the Q1.

After doing som research on keycaps I found that they can get crazy
expensive! Like $500 for a set! That then there's also the risk that
you might not have all the caps for your board!

## What about the ping?

## Programmable with Via and QMK

## But what's it like to use?

Honestly
