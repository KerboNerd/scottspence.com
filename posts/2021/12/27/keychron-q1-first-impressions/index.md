I've now gone through quite a few mechanical keyboards in a relatively
short time. The first couple of times were to replace the current
faulty one I was using. This time around it was more of a
sustainability decision than a replacement.

First up was the [Logitech G815] because I had issues with the Ctrl
key on the [HAVIT KB395L] the [Logitech G915] seemed like a logical
next step from there for me because I didn't really vibe with the
Logitech macro keys on the far left of the board.

The G915 was (and still is) a really nice board to type on.

## Why change from the G915

The G915 was what I thought to be my "end game" board. It had the
media controls on it, which was a main decicion in me getting it. It
also had the super nice low profile Kailh switches I really liked
typing on.

The only thing is with a factory made board like this, if there's
issues with one of the switches, you can't just replace it. So, say
the Ctrl key starts playing up again (which it did). There's two
options, open up the keyboard to replace the broken part. Or replace
the entire keyboard.

When this happened I did a bit of research and found a couple of
YouTube videos:

- [Logitech G915 Disassembly]
- [Logitech G815 Disassembly]:

There's a whole lot of screws that comes out of that board! Also other
things like a heat gun you'd need (or hair drier) a soldering iron and
sourcing the new parts!

## Let's go custom!

So the Keychron Q1 was what I settled on after

## Keycaps

I still really like the ISO keyboard layout (large enter key) and
there's surprisingly few boards out there that I could choose from.
